Hi! I'm Shaun ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a full-stack developer with 17 years' experience in business analysis, project management and SaaS sales. I recently took a career break to brush up on the most in-demand technologies including JavaScript, React, Node and Amazon Web Services. Now I'm done and ready to get back to work!

My background helps me ask the right questions, interpret the answers and deliver on time. I'm used to working remotely and cross-functionally, skilled at requirement gathering and solution architecture, and now I also have the skills necessary to build full-stack web apps for mobile, tablet and desktop!

I am open to all opportunities, particularly those that offer remote work (or are based in London, Chelmsford, Colchester or Ipswich) and focus on JavaScript, React, Node and serverless deployments.
