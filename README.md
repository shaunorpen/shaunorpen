Hi! I'm Shaun ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a full-stack developer with 17 years' experience in business analysis, project management and SaaS sales. I recently took a career break to brush up on the most in-demand technologies including JavaScript, React, Node and Amazon Web Services. Now I'm done and ready to get back to work!

I am open to all opportunities, particularly those that offer remote work (or are based in London, Chelmsford, Colchester or Ipswich) and focus on JavaScript, React, Node and serverless deployments.
