### Hi! I'm Shaun 👋.

## I'm a full-stack developer specialising in JavaScript, React, Node and SQL.

I'm experienced in business analysis, project management and SaaS sales and recently took a career break to brush up on the most in-demand technologies including JavaScript, React, Node and Amazon Web Services. Now I'm done and ready to get back to work! 

I am open to all opportunities, particularly those that offer remote work (or are based in London, Chelmsford, Colchester, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds or Norwich) and focus on JavaScript, React, Node and serverless deployments.
